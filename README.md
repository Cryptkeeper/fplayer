# fplayer
A work-in-progress C [fseq file](http://github.com/Cryptkeeper/fseq-file-format) player for 
[Light-O-Rama](https://lightorama.com) hardware. This project is a way for me to explore solutions to a 
better take on [libreorama](https://github.com/Cryptkeeper/libreorama) and may not lead to anything.

## Dependencies
fplayer offloads deserialization and encoding work to my other libraries, 
[libtinyfseq](https://github.com/Cryptkeeper/libtinyfseq) and 
[liblightorama](https://github.com/Cryptkeeper/liblightorama).
